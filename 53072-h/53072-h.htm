<span class="ig"><span class="letra">A</span>N April sun with April showers<br /></span>
<span class="ih">Had burst the buds of lagging flowers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From their fresh leaves the violets’ eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mirrored the deep blue of the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The daffodils, in clustering ranks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fringed with their spears the garden banks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the blooms I love so well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their paper buds began to swell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While every bush and every tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burgeoned with flowers of melody;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the quick robin with his range<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of silver notes, a warbling change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which he from sad to merry drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sparkling shower of tuneful dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the brown sparrow in the wheat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A plaintive whistle clear and sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over my head the royal sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread clear from cloud his canopy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2"></a>{2}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The idle noon slept far and wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On misty hill and river side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far below me glittering lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mirror of the azure bay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I stood beneath the maple tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its crimson blooms enchanted me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its honey perfume haunted me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drew me thither unaware,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A nameless influence in the air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its boughs were hung with murmuring bees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who robbed it of its sweetnesses&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their cheerful humming, loud and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drowned with its bass the robin’s song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And filled the April noontide air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Labor’s universal prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I paused to listen&mdash;soon I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sound of neither bee nor bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sullen murmur mixed with cheer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rose and fell upon the ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the wind might&mdash;yet far away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unstirred the sleeping river lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even across the hillside wheat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No silvery ripples wandered fleet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was the murmur of the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3"></a>{3}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">No song of bird or bee could drown&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rattling wheels along the street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pushing crowd with hasty feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The schoolboy’s call, the gossip’s story,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lawyer’s purchased oratory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glib-tongued shopman with his wares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chattering schoolgirl with her airs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moaning sick man on his bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coffin nailing for the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The new-born infant’s lusty wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bells that bade the bridal hail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The factory’s wheels that round and round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever turn, and with their sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make the young children deaf to all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God’s voices that about them call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet sounds of bird and wind and wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Life no gladder than a grave.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">These myriad, mingled human voices,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These intertwined and various noises<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made up the murmur that I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the sweet hymn of bee and bird.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I said&mdash;“If all these sounds of life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which the noontide air is rife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These busy murmurings of the bee<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4"></a>{4}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robbing the honied maple tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These warblings of the song-birds’ voices,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which the blooming hedge rejoices,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These harsher mortal chords that rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mar Earth’s anthem to the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If all these sounds fall on my ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So little varying&mdash;yet so near&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How can I tell if God can know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cry of human joy or woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the loud humming of the bee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the blithe robin’s melody?”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">God sitteth somewhere in his heaven&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About him sing the planets seven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every thought a world is made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To grow in sun or droop in shade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He holds Creation like a flower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his right hand&mdash;an æon’s hour&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It fades, it dies,&mdash;another’s bloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes the air sweet with fresh perfume.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, did he listen on that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what the rolling Earth might say?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, did he mark, as, one by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gliding hours in light were spun?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if he heard the choral hymn<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5"></a>{5}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Earth sent up to honor him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which note rose sweetest to his ear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which murmur did he gladliest hear?<br /></span>

<small><i>Poem founded on a Rabinnical Legend</i></small></h2>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ig"><span class="letra">A</span>BRAM and Zimri owned a field together,<br /></span>
<span class="ih">A level field, hid in a happy vale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They ploughed it with one plough, and in the spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sowed, walking side by side, the fruitful grain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each carried to his home one-half the sheaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stored them, with much labor, in his barns.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Abram had a wife and seven sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Zimri dwelt alone within his house.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One night, before the sheaves were gathered in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Zimri lay upon his lonely bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And counted in his mind his little gains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought upon his brother Abram’s lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, “I dwell alone within my house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Abram hath a wife and seven sons;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet we share the harvest sheaves alike:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He surely needeth more for life than I:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will arise and gird myself, and go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the field, and add to his from mine.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7"></a>{7}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he arose and girded up his loins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And went out softly to the level field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon shone out from dusky bars of clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trees stood black against the cold blue sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The branches waved and whispered in the wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Zimri, guided by the shifting light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went down the mountain path, and found the field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took from his store of sheave a generous third,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bore them gladly to his brother’s heap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then went back to sleep and happy dreams.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now that same night, as Abram lay in bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinking upon his blissful state in life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought upon his brother Zimri’s lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, “He dwells within his house alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He goeth forth to toil with few to help,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He goeth home at night to a cold house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hath few other friends but me and mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For these two tilled the happy vale alone),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I, whom Heaven hath very greatly blessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwell happy with my wife and seven sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who aid me in my toil, and make it light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet we share the harvest sheaves alike;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This, surely, is not pleasing unto God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8"></a>{8}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will arise and gird myself, and go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out to the field, and borrow from my store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And add unto my brother Zimri’s pile.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he arose and girded up his loins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And went down softly to the level field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon shone out from silver bars of clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trees stood black against the starry sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dark leaves waved and whispered in the breeze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Abram, guided by the doubtful light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed down the mountain path, and found the field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took from his store of sheaves a generous third,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And added them unto his brother’s heap;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he went back to sleep and happy dreams.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the next morning, with the early sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brothers rose and went out to their toil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when they came to see the heavy sheaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each wondered in his heart to find his heap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he had given a third, was still the same.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the next night went Zimri to the field,<br /></span>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
